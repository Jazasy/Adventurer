Welcome to Adventurer

This is my very own social media website. I wanted to create a platform that goes beyond the fake, unrealistic portrayals of life you often see on social media. Instead, Adventurer aims to turn everyday life into an exciting adventure.

On Adventurer, users can browse or create adventures that others can apply to join. Everything can be an adventure! Whether it’s climbing K2, traveling to China to learn Kung Fu, sailing across the Pacific Ocean, or anything else you can imagine.

The leader of each adventure can review applicants’ profiles to decide whether to accept them. They can see what type of adventures they have had. Once accepted, participants can post and use the chat function to discuss details with fellow adventurers. Unlike typical social media, users can not post directly to their profiles; instead, they can only share updates on the adventure pages. You can like and comment on posts within each adventure. There’s no "friending" feature here, users have to spend time together in real life to build connections.

This website is still under development. I have many features planned and a lot of work left to do on the design. Building Adventurer has been quite an adventure in itself too, as I’ve learned new skills like JWT-based authorization and authentication, implementing chat functions with Socket.io, and more.
